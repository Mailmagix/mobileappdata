    articleDescription: ` Perfectionism, like many other defence mechanisms, serves a purpose. Which is to protect you against difficult or problematic feelings. It is basically a defence against some deep upsetting feelings that you\'ve been trying to ward off because, at some point, you\'ve perhaps found it difficult to deal with them.
    
    Jane had a very critical mother, and perhaps her father was a bit critical too and they have high expectations of her. She is under a lot of pressure to live up to their standards and this makes her angry and agitated, but it is very difficult for her to become angry with them and protest against their high expectations.
    
    Instead, she decides to turn the anger towards herself, identify with the critical parents and begin to criticise herself for not meeting her ideal and perfectionist standards. So, instead of feeling anger or rage towards her parents, she does to herself what they do to her. A part of her becomes the critical mother or father. 
    
    For a perfectionist, being good enough is never enough. It may get to a point where she/he may never even be satisfied with a job well done. They can only see something missing. This can become very obsessive. An inner voice and dialogue punishes and puts the perfectionist down, constantly trying to find fault. That's why a perfectionist tends to procrastinate a great deal.
    
    Perfectionists feel anxious about what others think of them, so their level of anxiety about being ashamed or humiliated can be high. So, perfectionism is way of protecting themselves against the feeling of shame. At the same time, having constant self-critical thoughts will lead to low self-esteem and low moods. They tend to view the world as black or white, wonderful or horrible, always or never, and all or nothing.`,

    articleDescription: `Enjoyment is a powerful and delightful emotion that brings happiness to our lives. It can arise from various activities, experiences, or interactions with others. Understanding the experience of enjoyment can lead to a more fulfilling lisfe.
    
    The feeling of enjoyment is often associated with pleasure, excitement, and positive emotions. When you enjoy something, you are likely to feel a sense of satisfaction and contentment.
    
    However, the experience of enjoyment can vary from person to person. What brings enjoyment to one individual may not have the same effect on another. It is essential to explore and understand what activities or experiences truly bring you joy.
    
    The primary outcome of enjoyment is pos-itive affect, such as pleasure, satisfaction, gratiﬁ-cation, fulﬁllment, awe, pride, or gratitude. Thespeciﬁc types of positive emotions that are acti-vated during enjoyment depend largely on thesituation.
    
    Enjoy-ment is most closely associated with the hedonicconception of happiness. The modern-day conceptof enjoyment was also shaped by Epicurus (341BC–270 BC), who argued that a happy life couldbe obtained through seeking pleasure and avoidingpain.`,
